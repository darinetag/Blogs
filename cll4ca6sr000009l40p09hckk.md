The movie "Julie and Julia" most certainly reminds me of blogging for the first time EVER, as Julie embarks on a 365-day journey cooking every recipe in Julia Child's “Mastering the Art of French Cooking\*\*"\*\* as that led to the popular food blog the Julie/Julia Project. This perfectly describes my scenario, the blogging for the first time part of course.

Hello World, my name is <mark>Darine Tag</mark>, a devoted artist at heart and a translation graduate in real life and soon a Front-End Developer. I intend to share the blueprint of becoming and evolving in so, as I plan to dive deep into the tech industry and share the experience.

I come from a different yet interlinked background, translation. Both worlds are far apart yet connected just like the brain and heart. Languages are generally based on systems, creativity with systems, and thoughts and feelings coming to life. Coding is the same case yet computers go through that process under the control of humans. they both have languages, logic, systems, and things coming to life eventually.

I got introduced to this field by a mere coincidence. I love this story actually, not because it's mine xD but because now I understand why other things didn't work out for me before. As a translation student, I was working on a master's dissertation about Oscar Wilde's Satire in Drama. Pretty far from coding or the year 2023 even. But my friends were starting a startup as a dissertation topic, like 2 in 1, so peer pressure or just friendship had me switching to their team instead and work on "Website Translation". the keyword here is Website, and ... well it changed my life, still is and I am all for it. I started uncovering the depths of it by going through some basic markup languages like HTML, and CSS. And YES, I was definitely learning the wrong way; as in the conventional theoretical way of writing everything down in a copybook, TERRIFYING I KNOW! it took me a month or so. What follows is just as magical, it is closer to a quote by Rumi "Begin and the path shall unravel". I began, and the path got unravelled and surprisingly it is the flowery beautiful one that has light all along and not just at the end. This is the part where I should thank whoever invented social media algorithms, because of a single Ad, a try, a subscription, a test, an interview, and nowwww officially in a front-end development bootcamp for free; my story in a nutshell, but wait it's too good to be in a shell.

The amazing Re:coded bootcamp is the one I got in, The acceptance rate was remarkably competitive, standing at just 2% as in around 50 students out of 3120 got accepted and only 46% of them being women. I was privileged and utterly lucky to be one of them, with almost 0 background in the industry but this proves that everything is possible all you have to do is will. And that all you love can be combined in one, my case would be coding, languages, and art.

The true adventure kicked off as soon as Class 0 of the bootcamp set sail. I have so much to share about it from how it all started out as a blur on the horizon and how to change one's mindset to fit the free-shaped mole of how programmers think and code. You will witness my ups and downs and most likely share my feelings. I am an HSP ( highly sensitive person ) meaning I experience emotions to the extreme and can vocalize the exact feeling for you to easily understand and relate to. My most important mission though is to help out whoever is going through the same journey with me and have as much fun as possible out of it.
